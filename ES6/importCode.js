/*
Reuse JavaScript Code Using import

import allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load. In the previous lesson, the examples exported add from the math_functions.js file. Here's how you can import it to use in another file:

import { add } from './math_functions.js';

Here, import will find add in math_functions.js, import just that function for you to use, and ignore the rest. The ./ tells the import to look for the math_functions.js file in the same folder as the current file. The relative file path (./) and file extension (.js) are required when using import in this way.

You can import more than one item from the file by adding them in the import statement like this:

import { add, subtract } from './math_functions.js';

Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the uppercaseString and lowercaseString functions you exported in the previous lesson. These functions are in a file called string_functions.js, which is in the same directory as the current file.

*/
import{uppercaseString,lowercaseString} from './string_functions.js';
uppercaseString("hello");
lowercaseString("WORLD!");

//Using * to import all everything from a file.
/*
Use * to Import Everything from a File

Suppose you have a file and you wish to import all of its contents into the current file. This can be done with the import * as syntax. Here's an example where the contents of a file named math_functions.js are imported into a file in the same directory:

import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";

The above import statement will create an object called myMathModule. This is just a variable name, you can name it anything. The object will contain all of the exports from math_functions.js in it, so you can access the functions like you would any other object property. Here's how you can use the add and subtract functions that were imported:

myMathModule.add(2,3);
myMathModule.subtract(5,3);

The code in this file requires the contents of the file: string_functions.js, that is in the same directory as the current file. Use the import * as syntax to import everything from the file into an object called stringFunctions.
*/

import * as stringFunctions from './string_function.js';
// Only change code above this line

stringFunctions.uppercaseString("hello");
stringFunctions.lowercaseString("WORLD!");

/*
Create an Export Fallback with export default

In the export lesson, you learned about the syntax referred to as a named export. This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in other files.

There is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. Usually you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.

Below are examples using export default:

export default function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export default function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

The first is a named function, and the second is an anonymous function.

Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file, you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally, you cannot use export default with var, let, or const
*/
export default function subtract(x, y) {
    return x - y;
    }

//Import a Default Export
import subtract from "./math_functions.js";

subtract(7,4);
