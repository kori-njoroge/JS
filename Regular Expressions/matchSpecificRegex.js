/*
Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities

You learned how to match literal patterns (/literal/) and wildcard character (/./). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.

For example, you want to match bag, big, and bug but not bog. You can create the regex /b[aiu]g/ to do this. The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters a, i, or u.

let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex);
bagStr.match(bgRegex);
bugStr.match(bgRegex);
bogStr.match(bgRegex);

In order, the four match calls would return the values ["big"], ["bag"], ["bug"], and null.

Use a character class with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in your regex vowelRegex to find all the vowels in the string quoteSample.

Note: Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase vowels.

let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/ig; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // Change this line
console.log(result);

/*
Match Letters of the Alphabet

You saw how you can use character sets to specify a group of characters to match, but that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters (for example, every letter in the alphabet). Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: -.

For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use [a-e].

let catStr = "cat";
let batStr = "bat";
let matStr = "mat";
let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/;
catStr.match(bgRegex);
batStr.match(bgRegex);
matStr.match(bgRegex);

In order, the three match calls would return the values ["cat"], ["bat"], and null.

Match all the letters in the string quoteSample.

Note: Be sure to match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/ig; // Change this line
let result2 = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex); // Change this line
console.log(result);
