Positive and Negative Lookahead

Lookaheads are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.

There are two kinds of lookaheads: positive lookahead and negative lookahead.

A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as (?=...) where the ... is the required part that is not matched.

On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there. A negative lookahead is used as (?!...) where the ... is the pattern that you do not want to be there. The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.

Lookaheads are a bit confusing but some examples will help.

let quit = "qu";
let noquit = "qt";
let quRegex= /q(?=u)/;
let qRegex = /q(?!u)/;
quit.match(quRegex);
noquit.match(qRegex);

Both of these match calls would return ["q"].

A more practical use of lookaheads is to check two or more patterns in one string. Here is a (naively) simple password checker that looks for between 3 and 6 characters and at least one number:

let password = "abc123";
let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
checkPass.test(password);

Use lookaheads in the pwRegex to match passwords that are greater than 5 characters long, and have two consecutive digits.

let sampleWord = "astronaut";
let pwRegex = /(?=\w{6})(?=\w*\d{2})/; // Change this line
let result = pwRegex.test(sampleWord);


//Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters

/*Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters

Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().

If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: /P(engu|umpk)in/g

Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string by using the test() method.

let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
testRegex.test(testStr);

The test method here would return true.

Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.

Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false is returned depending on whether the regex matches.
*/
let myString = "Eleanor Roosevelt";
let myRegex = /(Eleanor|Franklin).* Roosevelt/ig; // Change this line
let result2 = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line
// After passing the challenge experiment with myString and see how the grouping works
console.log(result);
